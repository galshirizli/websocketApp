# Home Exercise â€“ Secure WebSocket

## Description
This solution demonstrates a setup with three containers:

1. **App1**: A simple Node.js application displaying "Hello World". It is exposed on port 3000.
2. **App2**: A WebSocket application that echoes messages sent to it. It is exposed on port 3001.
3. **Nginx**: A custom Nginx container that routes traffic to App1 and App2, operating with HTTPS protocol using a self-signed certificate.
